# My Weather App
## Description
This app is a basic weather website that lets the user type in a city name, gets the current city's weather, and what the 5 day forecast looks like.

## Installation
Simply click on the GitHub pages link and the site should work. You can also look at the GitHub repo

## Usage
To use this, it is very simple, all you need to do is type in the name of a city into the search bar. You will also see a history of the previous cities that you have searched, that you can click on and see the weather for.

## Testing
The only thing to test is to see how finnicky the city search is, you might want to make sure it is typed in correctly.

## Contributing
The module 6 code released helped me out because it made me realize the original way I was doing it just was not efficient, and would've required me to rewrite certain parts of the code multiple times, specifically when it came to rendering the boxes that show the weather. I did my best to explain every single part of the code to show you I understand what is going on. I also used openweathermap API's website, which helped me understand what I was doing
